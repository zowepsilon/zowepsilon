<h2>Hello there, I'm Anatom 🌸</h2>

I'm interested in language & compiler design, type systems, metaprogramming, automated proof checking and 3D rendering.

I love studying math, formal logic systems and reading about the philosophy of mathematics.

Functional programming is so good, and OCaml is interesting but Rust clears, sorry. 🦀
